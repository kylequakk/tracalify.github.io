Day 1: Friday, February 6th

Our team consisting of Dino, Kyle, Niko, and Caleb started working on our project.
Dissatisfied with the predatory monetization of calorie tracker apps, Dino suggestion making a completely free calorie tracker powered by the Google Gemini API. The basic concept of the app is to allow the user to take a photo of a food item, and then subtract the calorie amount from a limit specified by the user.

At the start, we made a loose plan with creating the front end of the app using an LLM and coding the backend using Java. We settled in using an IDE called IntelliJ, which supposedly provided free Github push/pull support. Our major first hurdle was attempting to set up the Github. None of us had used Github with an IDE before, so we were in for a real challenge. After some trial and error, it eventually worked. The team members were blown away by the ease of use of the IDE, as all of us had been used to using the EMACS text editor at the UGA CS1302 server “Odin”.

Next, the issue of saving user data surfaced. Everyone was unfamiliar with the process of creating a database. First the type of data being stored was clarified and specified. It was decided that meals, calories/macros, user accounts, and timestamps. PostGre SQL was selected as the database format of choice.

After an hour, a major breakthrough was made with the frontend. The GUI was displayed using html, and it was made through entirely through AI. Through a randomizer, a color scheme was generated based on a color wheel and exported as hexadecimal. Gree was the primary color of choice due to its association with “healthy foods.”

Day 2: Saturday, February 7th

Our team decided to begin the day by wrapping up our frontend design, and cracking down on what we were actually going to try and accomplish. Most of the time was spent trying to use a controller to connect our front and back ends, but we decided to land on Render for hosting a free backend local host. We didn't know if we wanted to add sign in mechanics, but after a few hours of stuggling we decided that was a little bit over our heads. 

As we approached the end of the day, we had a rough time implementing the back end. It all exists, and is on a seperate repo, but we just couldn't get all the pieces to fit together. We did what we could though, and we got the application to work with a fancy front-end and a working application for both iPhone and Android!
